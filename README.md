## 1. Introduction
OpenGait is a free software, aiming to bring together IMU-based gait algorithms in a single platform, allowing easy access to algorithms in the domain. This open source GitHub repository encourages algorithm authors to commit their algorithms in Python for use in the web application.

## 2. IMU Gait Algorithms and Open Science Practices
By having a repository of IMU-based gait algorithms, the research domain can become more accessible for a wider range of researchers. We have started to populate the repository with commonly-used algorithms within the domain, and will be actively adding more algorithms from relevant research. 

## 3. Tutorial
Check the algorithms that have been added thus far. Gait algorithms rely on CSV files with a combination of accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer signals. For example, an IMU may produce 6 columns in CSV format, e.g. "Acc X", "Acc Y", "Acc Z", "Gyro X", "Gyro Y", "Gyro Z". Please try to commit algorithms with a similar structure in mind. However, code can be adapted for use within the web application by the internal team.
