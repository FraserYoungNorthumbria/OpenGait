**Description:** This study introduces a new method of extracting initial and final contact gait time events from vertical acceleration, measured with one waist mounted inertial measurement unit, by means of continuous wavelet transforms. The method was validated on 18 young healthy subjects and compared to two others available in the literature. Of the three methods investigated, the new one was the most accurate at identifying the existence and timing of initial and final contacts with the ground, with an average error of 0.02 ± 0.02 s and 0.03 ± 0.03 s (approximately 2% and 3% of mean stride duration), respectively.
